Left, Right, and Center

This file is essentially a table of contents for my asgn1 submission

1) README.md - this file

2) Makefile - tool to enable simple compilation of my lrc.c program, also contains
   a "clean", "clang", "infer", etc, tools for ease of performance analysis.

3) lrc.c - the C source code file that contains my program for the game "Left, Right,
   and Center."

4) DESIGN.md - a document that describes the logical flow and overall design of my code.

5) Usage: To execute the makefile, simply enter "make" into the command line and press "enter". 
		  To clean the directory, simply enter "make clean" and press enter. 
		  To check for bugs or potential issues with the current version of the code, simply
		  enter "make infer" and press enter.
		  To format the code to a matching/cohesive style, use "make clang" and press "enter."
